# 🍿 Netflix Hook Generator

An interactive Netflix-style tool that turns any movie or TV show name — even with typos or alternate titles like **"Money Heist"** — into an exciting, binge-worthy hook that makes you want to hit play immediately!

Built with Python, pandas, and ipywidgets in Google Colab. No machine learning training needed — just smart lookup, fuzzy matching, and fun rephrasing using real Netflix data.

##  Features

- **Fuzzy Search**: Handles typos (e.g., "Squd Game" → "Squid Game")
- **Alternate Titles Support**: "Money Heist" automatically maps to "La Casa de Papel"
- **Engaging Hooks**: Original Netflix description transformed into an addictive one-liner with genre-based flair
- **Rich Details**: Shows movie/TV show type, release year, rating, and genres
- **Beautiful Netflix-Themed UI**: Red button, dark mode card — feels like the real Netflix app!
- **Fast & Lightweight**: Runs instantly in Colab, no GPU or external APIs needed
